# CodeClauseInternship_Gold-Price-Prediction
# Introduction:
Gold is a highly valued commodity, and predicting its price is a valuable tool for investors and people who want to buy gold. However, predicting the price of gold has traditionally been a challenging task due to its volatile nature. 
# Problem:
The main challenge in predicting the price of gold is its volatility. It's difficult to account for all the factors that impact its price, including political and economic events, currency fluctuations, and supply and demand. As a result, traditional methods of predicting gold prices are often unreliable.
# DATASET:
Since the dataset is not the actual market price of gold, we decided to get the market price of gold in India. There were no datasets available for the same. We scraped the market data from ​ Gold Price India​ from 2013 - 2018 for every month.
